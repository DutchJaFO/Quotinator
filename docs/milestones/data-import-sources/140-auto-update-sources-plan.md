# #140 — Auto-update bundled source files from manifest URL on startup

**Status:** Not started  
**GitHub issue:** #140  
**Depends on:** #58 fix (manifest `url` field), #62 (`AutoUpdateSources` follows same config pattern)  
**Unblocks:** retirement of `scripts/sources.json`

**Note (2026-06-30):** #63 already did the schema/manifest/`SeedFile` groundwork this spec needs — `schemas/manifest.schema.json` now has a `downloadUrl` field plus a `github: {owner, repo, path, branch}` object (computes `url`/`downloadUrl` from GitHub's standard URL conventions), `data/sources/manifest.json`'s `vilaboim`/`NikhilNamal17` entries use the `github` kind, and `SeedFile` carries a `DownloadUrl`. #140's remaining scope is purely the HTTP GET + temp-file-substitution mechanism described below, plus the `Quotinator__AutoUpdateSources` config key — it can consume `SeedFile.DownloadUrl` directly via `IManifestSeedPlanner`/`ManifestSeedPlanner`, no further manifest-format work needed.

---

## Spec requirements

1. `Quotinator__AutoUpdateSources` config key (default `true`) — when `false`, skip all URL checks
2. On startup and reseed: for each manifest entry with a `downloadUrl` (set explicitly or computed from a `github` object — see #63), attempt `GET` with a short timeout (5 s)
3. On success: overwrite local source file; log at `Information` level
4. On failure: log a warning; continue with existing local file — never a startup failure
5. Bundled sources only — user import files have no URLs and are not affected
6. HA write-path constraint: `/app/data/sources/` is read-only under HA supervisor; downloaded files must go to `{dataDir}/sources/` on the persistent volume

---

## Write-path approach — temp directory

Downloaded files are written to a temp directory (`Path.GetTempPath()`), not to the image-bundled `data/sources/` directory (which is read-only under the HA supervisor). The temp path is passed to the seeder in place of the bundled path for that file. After seeding completes the temp files are deleted.

This works because seeding only runs when the database is empty (or on explicit reseed) — the download only needs to survive long enough to seed from. On container restart with a populated database, seeding is skipped and the temp files are never needed.

**Flow:**
1. For each `SeedFile` with a `DownloadUrl` (and `AutoUpdateSources=true`): attempt `GET` with 5 s timeout
2. On success: write to a temp file; substitute the temp path for the bundled path in the seeder's file list; log at `Information`
3. On failure: log a warning; keep the bundled path — seeder uses the existing local file
4. Seeding completes → delete all temp files

## Step status

- [ ] `Quotinator__AutoUpdateSources` config key (default `true`)
- [ ] Startup/reseed `GET` per manifest entry with a `downloadUrl`, 5 s timeout
- [ ] Success path: overwrite local source file, log at `Information`
- [ ] Failure path: log a warning, continue with existing file, never crash startup
- [ ] Scoped to bundled sources only — user import files unaffected
- [ ] Downloads write to a temp directory, never to the read-only bundled `data/sources/` path

| 3 | ❌ | Successful download overwrites local file and logs at Info | Unit test | To be named |
| 4 | ❌ | Network failure logs warning and uses local file; startup succeeds | Unit test | To be named |
| 5 | ❌ | User import files are not affected | Unit test | To be named |
| 6 | ❌ | Downloads write to a temp directory, not the read-only bundled sources path | Unit test | To be named |
