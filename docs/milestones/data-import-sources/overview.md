# Data Import & Sources — Milestone Overview

**GitHub milestone:** [#10](https://github.com/DutchJaFO/Quotinator/milestone/10)
**Branch:** `feature/data-import-sources`
**Status:** In progress — session 2026-06-30: #58 post-closure regression fixed, #57 fully resolved in code, #63 implemented, all three T1+T2 verified. #140 unblocked by #63's manifest groundwork but not started. Session 2026-07-01: #62's `ImportBatchType` accuracy conflict resolved (four-value type + migration 5) plus all three remaining config keys (`IncludeDefaultSources`, `ImportsPath`, legacy `DataPath` warning) — #62 is now **fully resolved in code**, T1+T2 verified for all of it; reseed/reset preservation split out as follow-up #141 under this milestone. Session 2026-07-02: #141 scoped down (after cross-checking the spec against the current code with the user) to genuinely whole-table system tables — `AuditEntries` now always survives a full Reset (previously silently wiped, contradicting the issue's own premise), and `SchemaVersion`'s clear-and-replay-on-Reset behaviour is now optional via `preserveSchemaVersion`, defaulting to the unchanged historical behaviour. Row-level preservation of curated (`System`-classified) rows inside `Quotes`/`Sources`/`Characters`/`People` was explicitly ruled out of scope — that content is re-seeded on every reseed/reset regardless. #141 is code-complete, all unit tests green, no live tier required. Nothing in this milestone has shipped in a release since v1.4.1 — all completed work below is "pending release," including #62 and #141 in full.

---

## Description

Import pipeline infrastructure: per-source data files, startup seeder, import endpoint, ImportBatches provenance tracking, and database soft-reset. This is the foundation that the Blazor import UI (v3 milestone) builds on.

---

## Verification tier definitions

| Tier | Environment | What it catches |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| **T1 — VS/local** | Visual Studio on Windows | Razor runtime errors (not caught by `dotnet build`), Blazor circuit startup, UI rendering, manual API interaction, `Program.cs` startup behaviour |
| **T2 — Docker** | `docker build` + `docker run` locally | Publish output completeness, container startup, Kestrel port binding, `data/sources/` presence in image |
| **T3 — HA add-on** | Live Home Assistant supervisor | Ingress routing, `X-Ingress-Path` middleware, supervisor volume mount at `/data`, DataProtection keys, SSL cert loading, cookie behaviour after container restart, supervisor log output |

Full tier definitions and classification rules: [`docs/release-verification.md`](../release-verification.md)

**An issue can only be closed after:**
1. It is included in a published release (beta or final as appropriate)
2. Every required tier for that issue is confirmed green
3. Explicit user confirmation is given to `gh issue close`

## Pending verification before close

These issues are code-complete but cannot be closed until a release ships and any remaining tiers are confirmed.

### #58 — ImportBatches schema (post-closure regression fix)
**Shipped in:** (next release)
T1 ✅ verified 2026-06-30 (VS run; SQL Object Explorer confirmed curated→`System`/`NULL`, vilaboim/NikhilNamal17→`Seed`/GitHub URL)
T2 ✅ verified 2026-06-30 (`docker build` succeeded; container log showed identical seed counts to T1; `/api/v1/health`, `/api/v1/version`, `/api/v1/quotes/random` smoke tests passed)
No T3 requirements for this fix.

Full verification table: [58-import-batches-schema-plan.md](58-import-batches-schema-plan.md)

---

### #57 — Seed script: dedup inconsistent
**Shipped in:** (next release)
No live tier applies — Problem 4's fix lives entirely in `QuotinatorDatabaseInitializer` (engine layer); fully covered by unit tests. See the plan doc's Tiers line for the full reasoning.

Full verification table: [57-seed-script-dedup-plan.md](57-seed-script-dedup-plan.md)

---

### #63 — Import manifest
**Shipped in:** (next release)
T1 ✅ verified 2026-06-30 (VS run; `imports\manifest.json` auto-created with `[Database - Init]` warning logged via Serilog; bundled-dir `github`-kind entries seed without regression; empty-file crash found and fixed during this verification pass)
T2 ✅ verified 2026-06-30 (`docker build`/`docker run`; smoke tests passed; `docker exec` into the running container confirmed auto-create works identically inside `/app/data/imports`)
No T3 requirements for this issue.

Full verification table: [63-import-manifest-plan.md](63-import-manifest-plan.md)

---

### #62 — Folder-based seeder (fully resolved in code)
**Shipped in:** (next release)
T1 ✅ verified 2026-07-01 — two rounds:
  - `ImportBatchType` accuracy fix: VS run against an existing non-empty dev database — migration 4→5 applied cleanly, `dummy1.json`/`Dummy2.JSON` in the imports folder correctly reclassified `UserSeed` on reseed.
  - Three config keys: `Quotinator__IncludeDefaultSources=false` correctly skips bundled sources on a fresh DB; `Quotinator__ImportsPath` correctly redirects the imports scan to a custom folder; `Quotinator__DataPath` still set correctly logs the deprecation warning. Default behavior (no overrides) confirmed unchanged.

T2 ✅ verified 2026-07-01 — same two rounds, in Docker:
  - `docker build`/`docker run`; fresh container built schema straight to v5; `container-dummy.json` present in a pre-mounted volume confirmed `UserSeed` via direct DB query.
  - All three config keys confirmed via `-e` env vars against fresh containers, identical behavior to T1.

No T3 requirements for any part of this issue.

### #141 — System table preservation on Reset (AuditEntries, SchemaVersion)
**Shipped in:** (next release)
No live tier applies — the change is confined to `Sql.cs`, `DatabaseInitializer.cs`, `IDatabaseInitializer.cs`, and `AdminEndpoints.cs`; no Razor/Blazor, Dockerfile, or `Program.cs` startup changes. Fully covered by unit tests.

Scope was narrowed from the original issue text after cross-checking it against the current code (see plan doc's "Scope narrowed" section): `AuditEntries` preservation was pulled into scope (the issue's premise that it already survived reset was wrong for a full Reset — only true for Reseed), while row-level preservation of curated content inside `Quotes`/`Sources`/`Characters`/`People` was ruled out (that content is always re-seeded, so it doesn't need protecting).

## Dependency map

```
#71 (generic repository) → prerequisite for #78 and #58; unblocks all future repository implementations
#78 (transaction support) → requires #71; prerequisite for #45 and #58 (seeder needs atomic batch inserts)
#57 (dedup) → Problems 1–3 closed by design via #61; Problem 4 (ImportBatch) required #58 — done
#61 (per-source files) → #62, #63, #68 depend on it
#63 (manifest) → #62 reads it; #64 references it; #140 needs its downloadUrl/github groundwork — done
#62 (folder seeder) → prerequisite for #64 per-source overrides; ImportBatchType accuracy fix (2026-07-01) unblocks #141
#141 (system table preservation on Reset) → requires #62's ImportBatchType fix (done); scoped to AuditEntries/SchemaVersion only — done
#64 (conflict policy) → requires #63 for manifest field, #45 for per-run override, #58 for batch recording
#65 (preview) → requires #45 for the correct endpoint shape
#58 (ImportBatches) → requires #71 and #78; unblocks #56, #57 (Problem 4 — done), #59, #45 (batch row), #64, #67, #68, #69
#45 (import endpoint) → unblocks remaining #64 requirements and #65 final shape
#55 (completeness flag) → independent; connects to #56 (no-value-known)
#56 (audit log) → requires #58 for batch actor; connects to #45, #55, #59
#59 (soft-reset by batch) → requires #58 and #56
#67 (conversations schema) → requires #58 for batch FK; unblocks #68, #69
#68 (curated format) → requires #67, #61
#69 (API conversations) → requires #67, #68
#140 (auto-update sources) → requires #58 fix + #63 (both done); remaining scope is HTTP GET + temp-file substitution
```

## PR merge plan

**Default assumption:** the full milestone is completed before merging to `main`.

### Issues already merged (previous partial merges)

| Issue | Merged | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| #61 | ✅ | Self-contained — per-source file layout; no dependents called it at merge time |
| #71 | ✅ | Self-contained — generic repository infrastructure; nothing called it at merge time |
| #78 | ✅ | Self-contained — transaction support; nothing called it at merge time |
| #58 | ✅ | Merged via PR #85 (2026-06-20). Adds `ImportBatches` table, repository, and seeder wiring. Issue closed; a post-closure `Type`/`Url` regression was found and fixed 2026-06-30 (T1+T2 verified) but has not shipped in a release yet — see [58-import-batches-schema-plan.md](58-import-batches-schema-plan.md). |

### Evaluation of remaining issues

All remaining issues are either partially done or not started. Evaluate each for early merge when complete — the default is to merge the full milestone together.
